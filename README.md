# Can you beat Mewtwo? 

## Description

Hi (: 
I'm learning Python right now and I wanted to get familiar with the basic syntax, data structures, loops, etc and how it differs from Typescript. 
I chose to make an easy terminal game, where you fight against Mewtwo by having to choose random pokemon based on their stats and types in the terminal.
It was fun and I quickly learned a lot about the syntactic differences to TS. 
If you want to enjoy the game too, feel free to fork the repo and try it out in your terminal either on your computer or in the terminal in vs-code.
To get started, simply cd into the root folder and type `python3 terminal_game.py`
Have fun (:
